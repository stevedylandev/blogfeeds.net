        <p>Let me reassure you, this is actually simpler than what you're probably thinking. This doesn't have to be some well polished highly viewed monetization machine. It's just a simple website where you can casually talk about whatever you want to talk about! It can be long, short, a list of small things, or just a quote. It should be how you talk with other people in your own life, or how you communicate with the outside world. It should be you on a page. Here's a few places you can make a blog that are RSS enabled:</p>

        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">RSS</h2>

        <p>Also known as "really simple syndication", RSS has been around for decades. In short, it's simply a list of data that can be updated and notify people when something new has been posted. This is great for blogs since you don't have to always check all the people you want to follow. When you make your blog, you want to make sure it's RSS enabled (resources are further down). You also will want to get an RSS reader, as this will allow you to create a list of people to follow and let you read posts as they are published. These can vary from hosted web platforms where you might need to pay at some point to just free apps you can download. Would highly recommend trying a few and seeing which works best!</p>

        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold" id="feeds">Feeds</h2>

        <p>This takes us to our final point: Feeds. You can probably get away with just the first two items and then sharing it with people you already know, but what about meeting or talking to people you don't know? That's where Feeds come in. The idea is to create another page on your blog that has all the RSS feeds you're subscribed to. By keeping this public and always up to date, someone can visit your page, find someone new and follow them. Perhaps that person also has a feeds page, and the cycle continues until there is a natural and organic network of people all sharing with each other. So if you have a blog, consider making a feeds page and sharing it! If your RSS reader supports OPML file exports and imports, perhaps you can share that file as well to make it easier to share your feeds.</p>

            </summary>
            <div class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-7">
              Not necessarily! Most people have already ditched social media, and the way Blog Feeds operates doesn't act like a drop in replacement. It's a different style of interacting with people on the web. It's slower, more personal, and has much different incentives. Everyone is different so choose what works best for you; we just ask you give Blog Feeds a shot!

              Most blogs have comments available if you wish to use them, or you could go even further on a technical level and incorporate platforms like BlueSky to have comments. Another approach is just letting people email you so you can discuss on a more personal level. Choose what fits you and your nearby community best!
