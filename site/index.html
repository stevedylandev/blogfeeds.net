        <p>You just write what's on your mind, respond to an idea, post a recipe, or share a photo. It's blogs, but perhaps not in the way you would think of blogs.</p>

        <p>It just takes three things to participate:</p>

        <p>Let me reassure you, this is actually simpler than what you're probably thinking. This doesn't have to be some well polished highly viewed monetization machine. It's just a simple website where you can casually talk about whatever you want to talk about! It can be long, short, a list of small things, or just a quote. It should be how you talk with other people in your own life, or how you communicate with the outside world. It should be you on a page. Here's a few places you can make a blog that are RSS enabled:</p>

        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">RSS</h2>

        <p>Also known as "really simple syndication", RSS has been around for decades. In short, it's simply a list of data that can be updated and notify people when something new has been posted. This is great for blogs since you don't have to always check all the people you want to follow. When you make your blog, you want to make sure it's RSS enabled (resources are further down). You also will want to get an RSS reader, as this will allow you to create a list of people to follow and let you read posts as they are published. These can vary from hosted web platforms where you might need to pay at some point to just free apps you can download. Would highly recommend trying a few and seeing which works best!</p>

      <div class="max-w-xl space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">Feeds</h2>

        <p>This takes us to our final point: Feeds. You can probably get away with just the first two items and then sharing it with people you already know, but what about meeting or talking to people you don't know? That's where Feeds come in. The idea is to create another page on your blog that has all the RSS feeds you're subscribed to. By keeping this public and always up to date, someone can visit your page, find someone new and follow them. Perhaps that person also has a feeds page, and the cycle continues until there is a natural and organic network of people all sharing with each other. So if you have a blog, consider making a feeds page and sharing it! If your RSS reader supports OPML file exports and imports, perhaps you can share that file as well to make it easier to share your feeds.</p>

        <p>The best part about blog feeds? It's just an idea. There's no central authority. There's no platform. No massive tech giant trying to take your data. It's just you and the people you care about.</p>
